Project: DNA Visualization

Originator of base code: Al Swigart

About: This program creates a scrolling animation by printing strings from the ROWS list. The AT and CG pairs are inserted into each string with the format() string method.

What I learned: this code has helped me to work with string templates and randomly generated text.
